1. momentum (2~3 ts returns) & prev-price lagging prediction (LR) => short-term long/short
2. humidity outside range => humidity, sunlight both 'starting' to decrease -> strong short signal for longer term
3. tariffs -> compare current ask/bid with export sell price & import buy price for mean reversion / arbitrage
